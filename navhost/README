navhost
=======
navhost is a CGI script written in Perl.  It lists remote files in
browser window similar how `ls` does for local ones and allows to
view readable files.

The script itself contains the HTML templates which are attached to
the data section of the script.  Usually, changes do not need to be
made there, but amending the config section is emphasized.
